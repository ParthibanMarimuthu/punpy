# punpy: Propagating Uncertainties with PYthon

**punpy** is a Python software package to propagate random, structured and systematic uncertainties through a given measurement function.

punpy is part of the [CoMet Toolkit](https://www.comet-toolkit.org) (community metrology toolkit), and can combined with the [punpy](https://punpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (propagating uncertainties in python) module for very simple propagation of defined data uncertainties through arbitrary python functions.

## Installation

punpy is installable via pip.
